Research Problem
What problem does your research address, why is it important, and how success looks like

Problem: Current AI models cannot reliably predict how cells respond to genetic perturbations across different cell types. Despite massive single-cell datasets, we lack standardized benchmarks to evaluate whether models capture generalizable biological mechanisms or just dataset artifacts.

Importance: Virtual cells that accurately predict perturbation responses would transform biologyâ€”replacing expensive experiments, accelerating drug discovery, and revealing causal gene-function relationships. The field currently wastes resources on models that fail to generalize beyond training contexts.

Success metrics: The Virtual Cell Challenge defines success through three complementary metrics:
1. Differential expression accuracy - predicting which genes change expression after perturbation
2. Perturbation discrimination - distinguishing between different genetic interventions by their effects  
3. Global expression prediction (MAE) - capturing the full transcriptomic response

Success means building models that excel across all three metrics when predicting responses to held-out perturbations in new cell types with minimal adaptation data. The immediate benchmark: accurately predicting 100 unseen genetic perturbations in H1 stem cells given only 150 training perturbations in that cell type, leveraging cross-cell-type knowledge from 350M+ cells in public datasets.

Long-term success: models that replace bench experiments for perturbation screening, enabling in silico exploration of genetic interventions across any human cell type.
